It is important that your colors look good for everyone! Here are some things to think about:

  - **Color Blindness** is when someone cannot distinguish certain colors easily. There are [so many different types of color blindness](http://www.alanzucconi.com/2015/12/16/color-blindness/) that a good option is to offer a couple alternate color schemes and let folks choose what works for them.

  - **Bad Contrast** is when you have two different colors, but their perceived *brightness* is similar. This can make text really hard to read for some folks.

In both cases, the solution will be specific to your color scheme and the particulars of your design. For example, say your color scheme has two colors with bad contrast. If those colors are never used near each other, that is fine! But if one is text and the other is the background, that is a problem!
